      <h1>Privacy Policy for Socialo</h1>

      <p>Effective Date: [Insert Date]</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to Socialo, your go-to Chrome extension designed to generate
        engaging and grammatically correct comments for social media posts. Our
        goal is to help you interact with content on platforms like LinkedIn,
        Instagram, and Twitter, while ensuring that all your interactions are
        thoughtful, engaging, and professionally appropriate.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your
        personal information when you use the Socialo extension. By installing
        and using Socialo, you agree to the collection and use of your data as
        outlined below.
      </p>

      <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We believe in being transparent about the data we collect and why we
        collect it. The following data is collected:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>User Preferences:</strong> We store your configuration
          settings locally on your browser to personalize your experience. This
          includes your preferences for the type of comments generated (e.g.,
          tone, style) and other settings you may adjust.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>API Keys:</strong> If you link your Socialo account to an API
          service (such as Gemini API for AI-based suggestions), we store your
          API keys securely to enable communication with the service. This data
          is never shared externally and is only used for the purpose of
          enhancing your user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect any
          personal information like your name, email address, or social media
          account details. The extension only interacts with the data required
          to generate comments for social media posts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usage Data:</strong> While we do not collect personal
          information, we may collect anonymized usage data related to how you
          interact with the extension. This can help us improve the
          functionality and user experience of Socialo in the future.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We use the data we collect to enhance the functionality of Socialo,
        which includes the following purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Comment Generation:</strong> The primary function of the
          extension is to generate AI-powered comments for social media posts.
          The settings you select (e.g., tone, style) will be used to customize
          the suggestions provided.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personalization:</strong> Storing your preferences allows us
          to provide a more tailored experience the next time you use Socialo.
          This includes maintaining your settings, preferred comment styles, and
          previous interactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improvement of the Extension:</strong> We may analyze usage
          data in an anonymized form to improve the quality of the comments
          generated and ensure the extension works efficiently across different
          platforms.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Protect Your Data</h2>
      <p>
        We take data security very seriously. All data collected by Socialo is
        stored locally in your browser and is never shared or transmitted to
        external servers unless specified by you (e.g., linking to external
        APIs). Furthermore, we implement standard encryption techniques to
        protect your data from unauthorized access.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also follow best practices to safeguard your API keys. These are
        never transmitted in plain text and are used only to communicate with
        the respective API service for comment generation.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>
      <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can request access to any data
          that we store locally within the extension, including your preferences
          and API keys.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to Deletion:</strong> You can delete your stored
          preferences and settings directly from the extension. This will remove
          all data related to your usage of Socialo.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right to Modify Settings:</strong> You can update or change
          the settings at any time through the extensionâ€™s settings page to
          control how the extension behaves and interacts with your social media
          content.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        At this time, Socialo does not use cookies or any tracking technologies.
        The extension does not monitor your activity beyond its intended
        functionality of generating comments for social media posts.
      </p>

      <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not share any of your personal data with third parties. The only
        exception to this is if we are required by law to disclose information
        or if it is necessary for the purpose of providing the services of the
        extension (e.g., sending your API key to a third-party API service for
        comment generation).
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
        Any changes will be posted here, and we will indicate the date of the
        most recent update. We encourage you to review this page periodically to
        stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
      </p>
